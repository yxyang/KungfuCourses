{"depart": "Cognitive Science", "name": "Language and Thought", "prereq": ["Cognitive Science C 1"], "number": "C142", "units": "3", "descrp": "This seminar explores the relation of language and thought. Is language uniquely human, and if so, what does this reveal about the human mind? Does the particular language you speak affect the way you think, or do human languages reflect a universal conceptual repertoire? The goal of this class is to familiarize you with a set of classic arguments on these themes, together with current research that evaluates these arguments, through weekly reading and discussion. Also listed as Linguistics C142."}

{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "Biomedical Physiology for Engineers", "prereq": ["Bioengineering 10", "Biology  1A", "Math  54"], "number": "110", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course introduces students to the physiology of human organ systems, with an emphasis on quantitative problem solving, engineering-style modeling, and applications to clinical medicine. The course will begin with a review of basic principles of cellular physiology, including membrane transport and electrophysiology, and then take a system-by-system approach to the physiology of various organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and endocrine systems. Throughout, the course will feature extensive discussions of clinical conditions associated with dysfunction in specific physiological processes as well as the role of medical devices and prostheses. This course is geared towards upper-division bioengineering students who wish to solidify their foundation in physiology, especially in preparation for a career in clinical medicine or the biomedical device industry."}

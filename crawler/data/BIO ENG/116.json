{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "Cell and Tissue Engineering", "prereq": ["Bioengineering 102&C"], "number": "116", "units": "4", "descrp": "The goal of tissue engineering is to fabricate substitutes to restore tissue structure and functions. Understanding cell function in response to environmental cues will help us to establish design criteria and develop engineering tools for tissue fabrication. This course will introduce the basic concepts and approaches in the field, and train students to design and engineer biological substitutes. Lectures will be based on the textbook, the reference books and recent literature. Discussion sections will include the discussion of current literature and issues related to course content, homework, exams, and projects. Homework includes quantitative analysis, essay questions, and literature research. There will be a midterm exam, final exam, and a design project (presentation and paper). The final project will be a group project (three to four students) or independent project (required for graduate students). The topic will be chosen by each group and approved by instructor/GSIs."}

{"depart": "Statistics", "name": "Censored Longitudinal Data and Causality", "prereq": ["Public Health  240B", "Statistics  200A", "Statistics 200B"], "number": "C249A", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course examines optimal robust methods for statistical inference regarding causal and non-causal parameters based on longitudinal data in the presence of informative censoring and informative confounding of treatment. Models presented include multivariate regression models, multiplicative intensity models for counting processes, and causal models such as marginal structural models and structural nested models. Methods will be illustrated with data sets of practical interest and analyzed in the laboratory section. This course, appropriate for advanced masters and Ph.D. students, provides exposure to a number of ongoing research topics. Also listed as Public Health C246A."}

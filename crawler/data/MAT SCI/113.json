{"depart": "Materials Science and Engineering", "name": "Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials", "prereq": ["Mechanical Engineering C 85"], "number": "113", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course covers elastic and plastic deformation under static and dynamic loads. Prediction and prevention of failure by yielding, fracture, fatigue, wear and environmental factors are addressed. Design issues pertaining to materials selection for load bearing applications are discussed. Case studies of engineering failures are presented. Topics include engineering materials, structure-property relationships, materials selection for design, mechanical behavior of polymers and design of plastic components, complex states of stress and strain, elastic deformation and multiaxial loading, plastic deformation and yield criteria, dislocation plasticity and strengthening mechanisms, creep, effects of stress concentrations, fracture, fatigue, and contact stresses."}

{"depart": "Integrative Biology", "name": "Introduction to Systems in Biology and Medicine", "prereq": ["Biology  1A", "Mathematics  1A"], "number": "115", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course is aimed at students wishing to understand the general principles of how biological systems operate. Topics include feedback regulation; competition and cooperation; genetic switches and circuits; random processes; chaos; mechanisms for error correction; and the properties of networks. Examples are selected from many fields including medicine, physiology, ecology, biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics. Students will learn to conceptualize and quantify interactions within biological systems using simple mathematical models and computer programs. No previous experience in programming is required."}

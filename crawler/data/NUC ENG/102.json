{"depart": "Nuclear Engineering", "name": "Nuclear Reactions and Radiation Laboratory", "prereq": ["Nuclear Engineering 101"], "number": "102", "units": "3", "descrp": "Laboratory course in nuclear physics. Experiments will allow students to directly observe phenomena discussed in Nuclear Engineering 101. These experiments will give students exposure to (1) electronics, (2) alpha, beta, gamma radiation detectors, (3) radioactive sources, and (4) experimental methods relevant for all aspects of nuclear science. Experiments include: Rutherford scattering, x-ray fluorescence, muon lifetime, gamma-gamma angular correlations, Mossbauer effect, and radon measurements."}

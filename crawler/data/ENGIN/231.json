{"depart": "Engineering", "name": "Mathematical Methods in Engineering", "prereq": ["Math  1A", "Engineering 1B", "Engineering 53&54"], "number": "231", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course offers an integrated treatment of three topics essential to modern engineering: linear algebra, random processes, and optimization. These topics will be covered more rapidly than in separate undergraduate courses covering the same material, and will draw on engineering examples for motivation. The stress will be on proofs and computational aspects will also be highlighted. It is intended for engineering students whose research focus has a significant mathematical component, but who have not previously had a thorough exposure to these topics."}

{"depart": "Mechanical Engineering", "name": "Advanced Structural Aspects of Biomaterials", "prereq": ["Mechanical Engineering C 85"], "number": "C215", "units": "4", "descrp": "This course covers the structure and mechanical functions of load bearing tissues and their replacements. Biocompatibility of biomaterials and host response to structural implants are examined. Quantitative treatment of biomechanical issues and constitutive relationships of materials are covered in order to design implants for structural function. Material selection for load bearing applications including reconstructive surgery, orthopedics, dentistry, and cardiology are addressed. Also listed as Bioengineering C222."}

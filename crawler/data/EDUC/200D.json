The course begins with a discussion of Erikson's psychosocial theory and the sociocultural perspectives of Vygotsky and other theorists. We then review some of the major psychosocial variables related to educational achievement, including competence, motivation, self-concept, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and volition. We touch briefly on moral development and values as psychosocial factors affecting correlates. We examine (a) how social and personal identity factors are used to explain underachievement (e.g., cultural ecological theory and stereotype threat), (b) the role of identity in different cultural groups, (c) the impact of these factors on teacher and student behavior, and (d) the role that identity plays in helping students develop a sense of future."}

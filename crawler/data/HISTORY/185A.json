{"units": "4", "descrp": "The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the \"outside\" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.", "depart": "History", "number": "185A", "name": "History of Christianity to "}

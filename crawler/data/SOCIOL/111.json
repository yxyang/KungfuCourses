{"depart": "Sociology", "name": "Sociology of the Family", "prereq": ["Sociology 1", "Sociology 3"], "number": "111", "units": "4", "descrp": "In this course, we trace the history of the American family from the 19th-century farm--in which work, medical care, and entertainment went on--to the smaller, more diverse, and subjectively defined family of the 21st century. We also explore ways in which the family acts as a \"shock absorber\" of many trends including immigration, the increasing social class divide, and especially the growing domination of the marketplace. Finally, we also explore the diversity of family forms associated with social class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation."}

{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course will examine war, empire, and the writing and memorialization of history through an eclectic group of literary, graphic, and cinematic texts from China, Japan, Europe, and the U.S. We will begin by examining crucial issues of imperial power, violence, and historical representation through the lens of the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian's classic accounts of \"terrorism\" in the Warring States period, the rise of the Han empire, and its conflicts with the Hsiung-nu \"barbarians\" to the north. With these earlier examples in mind, we will turn our focus to two crucial conflicts in modern history - the Boxer Uprising of 1899-1900, and the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945 - and their diverse representations in a number of different times, places, and media.", "depart": "East Asian Languages and Cultures", "number": "107", "name": "War"}

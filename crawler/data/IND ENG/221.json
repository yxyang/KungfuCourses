{"depart": "Industrial Engineering and Operations Research", "name": "Introduction to Financial Engineering", "prereq": ["Industrial Engineering and Operations Research 162"], "number": "221", "units": "3", "descrp": "A course on financial concepts useful for engineers that will cover, among other topics, those of interest rates, present values, arbitrage, geometric Brownian motion, options pricing, and portfolio optimization. The Black-Scholes option-pricing formula will be derived and studied. Stochastic simulation ideas will be introduced and used to obtain the risk-neutral geometric Brownian motion values for certain types of Asian, barrier, and lookback options. Portfolio optimization problems will be considered both from a mean-variance and from a utility function point of view. Methods for evaluating real options will be presented. The use of mathematical optimization models as a framework for analyzing financial engineering problems will be shown."}

{"depart": "Psychology", "name": "Stigma and Prejudice", "prereq": ["Psychology 1"], "number": "167AC", "units": "3", "descrp": "Traditionally, research on prejudice and stereotyping has focused on the psychological mechanisms that lead people to be biased against others. Recent research has begun to shed light on the psychological legacy of prejudice and stereotyping for their targets. This course will review the major contributions of each of these literatures, providing students with a broad understanding of both classic and current issues in the field. The course will be divided into three sections: bias (i.e., the perpetrator's perspective), stigma (i.e., the target's perspective), and intergroup relations."}

{"depart": "Psychology", "name": "Psychology of Creativity", "prereq": ["Psychology 1"], "number": "165", "units": "3", "descrp": "This is a course on creativity, both at the individual and the group level. We will consider traits of highly creative individuals (vs. less creative individuals) and the ways in which they think. We will also investigate the ways in which influence processes affect individual creativity and will then focus on group creativity, including techniques by which creativity is hindered or stimulated. Finally, we will consider applications from organizations as we consider cultures in which creativity thrives. Throughout the course, discussion will be encouraged and we will also do some experiential exercises. The course will be a combination of lecture, discussion, and experiential learning."}

{"units": "2", "descrp": "The \"Hand-Printed Book\" is a studio course taught in the Bancroft press room. Using antique presses and 19th century type, each class produces by hand a rare first edition of a work from the Bancroft collections that has never been published before. As students learn how hand-produced books have been made in the west for the last 500 years, they are also taught about the history of the book, using examples from Bancroft's rare books and manuscripts collection.", "depart": "Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies", "number": "140", "name": "The Hand"}

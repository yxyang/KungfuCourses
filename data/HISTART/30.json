{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course surveys the arts of India from 2000 BC to the present, including painting, sculpture, and architecture. It treats prehistoric material (Indus Valley), Buddhist sculpture and painting, Hindu temples and their images, miniature painting, and modern art. Art will be considered in relation to its religious, political, and social contexts. The course will normally focus on major monuments, seen from multiple viewpoints, or upon problems and issues that relate the art of this area to traditions of other parts of the world (or differentiate it from them). No previous background is presumed, and students will be introduced to basic art-historical methods of viewing and analysis.", "depart": "History of Art", "number": "30", "name": "Art of India"}

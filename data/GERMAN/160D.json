We also engage critically with such concepts as migration, assimilation, citizenship, diaspora, hybridity, and authenticity, as well as rhetorical strategies of \"speaking back.\" We will focus on exemplary texts and films from Germany, but include comparisons with minority experiences in other countries.", "depart": "German", "number": "160D", "name": "Multicultural Germany"}

{"depart": "Public Health", "name": "Practical Toxicology", "prereq": ["Public Health 270B"], "number": "270C", "units": "2", "descrp": "This course will focus on cutting-edge issues involving real-world toxicology in drug discovery, pesticide regulation, stem cell research, etc. Many well-known toxicologists, regulators, and consultants from pharmaceutical companies, petroleum industry, private consulting firms, non-profit institutes, federal and state regulatory agencies in the Bay Area will be invited to talk to our participating students. Some of the speakers are our school's alumni who understand exactly what our students need to know before entering the real world. Learning outside the classroom will be another major focus and different from other existing toxicology courses offered at Berkeley. This new class will provide students a chance to visit some of the real-world sites allowing students to see and feel what they really need to know and to learn. To better prepare our students for the real world, we will use combined teaching/learning styles including lecture with discussion sections, site-visits, hand-on experience in a toxicology laboratory, and student group assignments or projects."}

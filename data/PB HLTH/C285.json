{"depart": "Public Health", "name": "Traffic Safety and Injury Control", "prereq": [], "number": "C285", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course applies principles of engineering, behavioral science, and vision science to preventing traffic collisions and subsequent injury. A systematic approach to traffic safety will be presented in the course, and will include (1) human behavior, vehicle design, and roadway design as interacting approaches to preventing traffic crashes and (2) vehicle and roadway designs as approaches to preventing injury once a collision has occured. Implications of intelligent transportation system concepts for traffic safety will be discussed throughout the course. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C265."}

{"depart": "Mechanical Engineering", "name": "Introduction to Nanotechnology and Nanoscience", "prereq": ["Chemistry  1A", "Physics  7C"], "number": "118", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course introduces engineering students (juniors and seniors) to the field of nanotechnology and nanoscience. The course has two components: (1) Formal lectures. Students receive a set of formal lectures introducing them to the field of nanotechnology and nanoscience. The material covered includes nanofabrication technology (how one achieves the nanometer length scale, from \"bottom up\" to \"top down\" technologies), the interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology and nanoscience (including areas of chemistry, material science, physics, and molecular biology), examples of nanoscience phenomena (the crossover from bulk to quantum mechanical properties), and applications (from integrated circuits, quantum computing, MEMS, and bioengineering). (2) Projects. Students are asked to read and present a variety of current journal papers to the class and lead a discussion on the various works."}

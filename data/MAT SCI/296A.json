{"depart": "Materials Science and Engineering", "name": "Independent Research for Five", "prereq": [], "number": "296A", "units": "1-2", "descrp": "This is the first semester of a two-course sequence for those majors in the five year BS/MS program. Students are expected to formulate, develop and initiate an independent research project under the supervision of a research advisor. This course will meet once at the beginning of the semester to outline the expectations of the course. Periodic meetings covering topics such as maintaining a lab notebook, effective oral communication, and writing a journal publication will be scheduled. Students will be expected to keep a laboratory notebook outlining their progress during the semester. A progress report will be due at the end of Materials Science and Engineering 296A. Students will also be expected to give an oral presentation, describing their research project and progress toward their goals in front of their peers at the end of the semester."}

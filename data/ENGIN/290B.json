{"units": "2", "descrp": "This course is designed to examine the strategic issues that confront the management of the development stage biotech company, i.e., after its start-up via an initial capital infusion, but before it might be deemed successful (e.g., by virtue of a product launch), or otherwise has achieved \"first-tier\" status. Thus, the intention is to study the biotech organization during the process of it growth and maturation from an early stage existence through \"adolescence\" into an \"adult\" company. The focus of the class will be on business development, i.e., the deal making that must occur to accomplish the corporate objectives of bringing in new technologies and getting the initial products to market. We will explore the critical deal issues from both the perspective of the development stage company and the viewpoint of the larger, more mature biotech or big pharma company with which it seeks to partner.", "depart": "Engineering", "number": "290B", "name": "Biotechnology"}

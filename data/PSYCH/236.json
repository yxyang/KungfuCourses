{"depart": "Psychology", "name": "Specialty Clinic", "prereq": [], "number": "236", "units": "3", "descrp": "A Specialty Clinic is offered to graduate students in the Clinical Science program. Each course combines didactics and hands-on clinical work. Students in the course work with the instructor to develop the topic of interest by reviewing the empirical literature, defining and developing an intervention/consultation, defining a clinical population, marketing and delivering the intervention/consultation, and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention/consultation. A number of readings are included in the course, and class discussion is a central part of the course. Written products are also a part of the course, either in the form of a presentation or publication of findings from the clinic. A Specialty Clinic also includes its own Case Conference and supervisors to handle supervision of the clinical cases."}

{"depart": "Bioengineering", "name": "Cell and Tissue Mechanotransduction", "prereq": [], "number": "211", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course will focus on biophysical and bioengineering aspects of mechanotransduction, the process through which living cells sense and respond to their mechanical environment. Students will learn how mechanical inputs to cells influence both subcellular biochemistry and whole-cell behavior. They will also study newly-engineered technologies for force manipulation and measurement in living cells, and synthetic strategies to control the mechanics and chemistry of the extracellular matrix. Finally, students will learn about the role of mechanotransduction in selected human organ systems and how these mechanisms may go awry in the setting of the disease. Instruction will feature lectures, discussions, analysis of relevant research papers, assembly of a literature review and a research proposal, and an oral presentation."}

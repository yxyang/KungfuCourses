{"depart": "Information", "name": "Concepts of Information", "prereq": [], "number": "218", "units": "3", "descrp": "As it's generally used, \"information\" is a collection of notions, rather than a single coherent concept. In this course, we'll examine conceptions of information based in information theory, philosophy, social science, economics, and history. Issues include: How compatible are these conceptions; can we talk about \"information\" in the abstract? What work do these various notions play in discussions of literacy, intellectual property, advertising, and the political process? And where does this leave \"information studies\" and \"the information society\"?"}

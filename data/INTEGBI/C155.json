Thus \"global change\" and the biodiversity crisis are not exclusively developments of the industrial and post-industrial world. This course uses a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing upon methods and data from archaeology, palynology, geomorphology, paleontology, and historical ecology to unravel the broad trends of human ecodynamics over the past 10,000 years. Also listed as Anthropology C129D."}

{"depart": "Education", "name": "Adolescent Development and the Teaching of Secondary English", "prereq": [], "number": "212", "units": "3", "descrp": "This graduate seminar relates the goals of secondary English teaching to three major themes in the study of adolescent development: rationality, morality, and identity. These themes are then explored with reference to urban youth, along with other themes emerging from research in urban settings. The theme of identity is pursued further through a consideration of adolescents' \"self-theories\" and their motivational consequences. Students write papers on related topics for a class anthology."}

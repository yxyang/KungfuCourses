{"depart": "History of Art", "name": "Reading and Writing about Visual Experience", "prereq": ["English  1A"], "number": "R1B", "units": "4", "descrp": "How do mechanisms of perception structure responses to visual art? What is at stake when words describe images? By means of intensive looking, thinking, speaking, and writing, this course introduces the student to a series of problems and issues in the description and analysis of works of art. Because the course is also an introduction to the historical study of art, it is intended for students with no previous course work in the field. Satisfies the second half of the Reading and Composition requirement."}

{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course introduces students to the use of computers in Landscape Architecture and Environmental Design. It develops applied computing skills in Web publishing, Computer Aides Design (CAD), image scanning, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). CAD is emphasized in the first half of the semester and includes: 2D and 3D modeling, object rendering, integration of images, fly-through movies, and solar studies. The rest of the semester expands spatial design, graphics, and virtual modeling by integrating support information from geographic information systems (GIS), digital ortho-photos (DOP/DOQ), and global positioning systems (GPS). Lecture time is spent discussing problems and solutions of data: acquisition, accuracy, representation, modeling, and communication in landscape design. The lab/studio seeks innovative application of technology to medium- to large-scale landscape design problems. The focus of the lab/studio varies from semester to semester, but typical topics include garden design, park design, neighborhood design, open space design, and others.", "depart": "Landscape Architecture", "number": "132", "name": "Computer Applications in Environmental Design"}

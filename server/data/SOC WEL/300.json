{"units": "2", "descrp": "This seminar aims to prepare doctoral students for teaching in social welfare. The course is divided into two parts. The first part examines education from the perspective of the student and the teacher, and their interface. It reviews philosophies and theories of adult education, and underscores the importance of critical reflection, both on the part of the teacher and the student. The second part of the course is concerned with the practice of teaching in social welfare, and addresses specific skills, such as syllabus design, instructional methods, coverage of diversity content, student assignment and evaluation, use of technology, advising, mentoring, and working with GSIs and students with special needs. Finally, students develop the beginnings of a teaching portfolio. Using an interactive format, students are encouraged to share their own learning and teaching experiences, and to progress in their development as teachers.", "depart": "Social Welfare", "number": "300", "name": "Teaching in Social Welfare"}

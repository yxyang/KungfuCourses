{"depart": "College Writing Program", "name": "Reading", "prereq": [], "number": "R4B", "units": "4", "descrp": "This writing seminar satisfies the second half of the Reading and Composition requirement. It is designed to offer students structured, sustained, and highly articulated practice in the recursive processes entailed in reading, critical analysis, and composing. In like manner, the seminar affords students guided practice through the stages involved in creating a research paper. Students will read five thematically related book-length texts, or the equivalent, drawn from a range of genres, in addition to various non-print sources. In response to these materials, they will craft several short pieces leading up to two longer essays--works of exposition and/or argumentation. Students will also draft a research paper, developing a research question, gathering, evaluating, and synthesizing information from texts and other sources. Elements of the research process, such as a proposal, an annotated bibliography, an abstract, a \"work cited\" list, and the like, will be submitted, along with the final report, in a research portfolio. Students will write a minimum of 32 pages of expository prose during the semester."}

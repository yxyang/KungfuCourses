{"depart": "Chemistry", "name": "General Chemistry and Quantitative Analysis", "prereq": [], "number": "4A", "units": "4", "descrp": "This series is intended for majors in physical and biological sciences and in engineering. It presents the foundation principles of chemistry, including stoichiometry, ideal and real gases, acid-base and solubility equilibria, oxidation-reduction reactions, thermochemistry, entropy, nuclear chemistry and radioactivity, the atoms and elements, the periodic table, quantum theory, chemical bonding, molecular structure, chemical kinetics, and descriptive chemistry. Examples and applications will be drawn from diverse areas of special interest such as atmospheric, environmental, materials, polymer and computational chemistry, and biochemistry. Laboratory emphasizes quantitative work. Equivalent to 1A-1B plus 15 as prerequisite for further courses in chemistry."}

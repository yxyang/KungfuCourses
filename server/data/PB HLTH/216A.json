{"units": "2", "descrp": "This is an interdisciplinary course which will adopt a broad-based ecological perspective of health and behavior. This class will emphasize the interconnected and multidirectional relationships between biology, behavior, and the social environment. This course will be conducted as a seminar series (with a focus on biological processes). We will investigate the assertion that biological, psychological, and social processes interact over a lifetime to influence health and vulnerability to disease (a developmental epigenetic perspective). Rather than focusing on \"if\" social factors can influence health and disease we will focus on \"how\" social factors may regulate/change biological measures. Three very general themes will be addressed: development, \"social\" neuroscience and gene-environment interactions as they relate to behavior. Topics such as constraints/plasticity and behavior, genetic determinism, vulnerability versus resilience, gene-environment interactions, fetal/developmental programming, and stress will all be touched upon.", "depart": "Public Health", "number": "216A", "name": "Biological Embedding of Social Factors"}

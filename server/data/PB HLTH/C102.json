{"depart": "Public Health", "name": "Bacterial Pathogenesis", "prereq": ["Chemistry C 130"], "number": "C102", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course for upper division and graduate students will explore the molecular and cellular basis of microbial pathogenesis. The course will focus on model microbial systems which illustrate mechanisms of pathogenesis. Most of the emphasis will be on bacterial pathogens of mammals, but there will be some discussion of viral and protozoan pathogens. There will be an emphasis on experimental approaches. The course will also include some aspects of bacterial genetics and physiology, immune response to infection, and the cell biology of host-parasite interactions. Also listed as Molecular and Cell Biology C103 and Plant and Microbial Biology C103."}

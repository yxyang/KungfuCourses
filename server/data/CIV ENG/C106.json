{"depart": "Civil and Environmental Engineering", "name": "Air Pollution", "prereq": ["Chemistry  1A", "Civil and Environmental Engineering 1B"], "number": "C106", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course is an introduction to air pollution and the chemistry of earth's atmosphere. We will focus on the fundamental natural processes controlling trace gas and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere, and how anthropogenic activity has affected those processes at the local, regional, and global scales. Specific topics include stratospheric ozone depletion, increasing concentrations of green house gasses, smog, and changes in the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. Also listed as Earth and Planetary Science C180 and Environ Sci, Policy, and Management C180."}

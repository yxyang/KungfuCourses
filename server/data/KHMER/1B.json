{"depart": "Khmer", "name": "Introductory Khmer", "prereq": ["Khmer 1A"], "number": "1B", "units": "5", "descrp": "Students complete their study of everyday standard Khmer to a \"survival\" level. While the memorization of vocabulary and common personal exchanges practiced in 1A will make up the majority of material studied, students will have some opportunity to learn to improvise and talk about personal work and research interests in Khmer. Topics include transportation and directions, the world of work, religion, health, and conducting daily life in Cambodia. Students learn to read simple authentic texts such as folk tales, personal letters, forms, and roadside signs. Students continue their study of culturally appropriate behavior in the context of Khmer culture, including notions of \"saving face\" and maintaining social harmony, and how these are expressed in both spoken language and in one's actions."}

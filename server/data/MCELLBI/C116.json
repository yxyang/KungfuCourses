{"depart": "Molecular and Cell Biology", "name": "Microbial Diversity", "prereq": [], "number": "C116", "units": "3", "descrp": "This course for upper-division and graduate students will broadly survey myriad types of microbial organisms, both procaryote and eucaryote, using a phylogenetic framework to organize the concept of \"biodiversity.\" Emphasis will be on the evolutionary development of the many biochemical themes, how they mold our biosphere, and the organisms that affect the global biochemistry. Molecular mechanisms that occur in different lineages will be compared and contrasted to illustrate fundamental biological strategies. Graduate students additionally should enroll in C216, Microbial Diversity Workshop. Also listed as Plant and Microbial Biology C116."}

{"units": "4", "descrp": "This course discusses various top-down and bottom-up approaches to synthesizing and processing nanostructured materials. The topics include fundamentals of self assembly, nano-imprint lithography, electron beam lithography, nanowire and nanotube synthesis, quantum dot synthesis (strain patterned and colloidal), postsynthesis modification (oxidation, doping, diffusion, surface interactions, and etching techniques). In addition, techniques to bridging length scales such as heterogeneous integration will be discussed. We will discuss new electronic, optical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties brought forth by the very small sizes.

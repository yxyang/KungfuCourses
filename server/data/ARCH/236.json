{"units": "3", "descrp": "The concept of space as it is applied to the fields of architecture, geography, and urbanism can be understood as a barometer of the condition that we call \"modernity.\" This course explores connections between the larger cultural frameworks of the past century, and the idea of space as it has been perceived, conceived, and lived during this period. Readings include key essays from the disciplines of philosophy, geography, architecture, landscape, and urbanism, and short works of fiction that illustrate and elucidate the spatial concepts. The readings are grouped according to themes that form the foundation for weekly seminar discussions. Chronological and thematic readings reveal the force of history upon the conceptualization of space, and its contradictions.", "depart": "Architecture", "number": "236", "name": "The Literature of Space"}
